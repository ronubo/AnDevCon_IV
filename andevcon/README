Tested on a various of
- ASUS laptops
- Dell laptops
- Dell workstations
- QEMU
- VirtualBox
- XEN
- VmWare

Features may or may work according to hardware types - but this is a good 
place to start with.

Recommended non virtualized environment will have an i915 supported graphic chipset.
SandyBridge / IvyBridge recommended.

Have fun!
